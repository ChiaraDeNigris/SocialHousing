### **Social Housing â€“ My First UX Project**  

**Social Housing** is my first UX project, born from a real challenge I faced while searching for a rental home. This ongoing project envisions an application designed to **streamline the rental process** from the initial search phase to finalizing agreements.  

For this first phase, I focused primarily on **research and design**, identifying key pain points in the current rental landscape. **SocialHousing** enhances the rental experience by not only providing essential property details but also allowing users to exchange insights with previous tenants or anyone who has interacted with the landlord.  

Unlike traditional rental platforms, **SocialHousing integrates social networking features**, enabling public comments, direct chats, and community-driven feedback. Listings undergo a **quality verification process**, ensuring both the accuracy of the information provided and the reliability of the properties listed.  

While this project is still in progress, I haven't delved deeply into its technical implementation. However, my technical background naturally leads me to consider these aspects as part of the broader design vision.
