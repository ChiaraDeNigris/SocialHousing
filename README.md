### **Social Housing â€“ my first UX project**  

Social Housing is my **first UX project** (I am _definitely_ a beginner), inspired by a real challenge I faced while searching for a rental home. This ongoing project envisions an application designed to streamline the rental process, from the initial search phase to finalizing agreements. I primarily focused on the research and design stages, applying various design methodologies that I found particularly interesting. You can find an overview of my work so far in **SocialHousing_FirstDraft.pdf**.  

To validate my assumptions about the difficulties of renting in Italy, I began by analyzing online data to assess whether this issue was as widespread as I perceived (spoiler: it is!). I then conducted interviews and distributed surveys among friends and colleagues, using the insights to create an affinity map. From there, I developed personas and mapped their customer journeys, identifying two main user types: tenants and landlords.  

Building on my research (which is still ongoing), I began refining my concept. I brainstormed ideas related to the rental process, exploring ways to enhance user experience. While I haven't deeply explored technical implementation yet, my background naturally pushes me to consider these aspects as part of the broader design vision. To prioritize key features, I used an Impact/Effort Matrix, identifying the most valuable functionalities to integrate. Of course, some of them are AI-powered: Social Housing could leverage AI in multiple ways, from smart assistants to help users find personalized listings to automating quality and scam detection for rental listings.  

I then started drafting the information architecture of the platform, which you can visualize in **SocialHousing_InformationArchitecture.jpg**.
